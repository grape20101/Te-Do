Welcome to Te-Do, a simple to-do list app for iOS, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedo_Zibzibadze">Tedo Zibzibadze</a>, a Georgian rugby union player.

Once it is completed, the main attractions will be:

### FOSS:
Te-Do is licensed under the GPL-3 copyleft license. This means it's completely free in  every way - "free as in freedom". Unlike most popular to-do apps, there are no charges, and you can redistribute or change the code however you want.

### Lightweight: 
The app is made to be very simple, free from any 'bloat' (extra features that you won't ever use). There is no calender, groups, or any other features; if you want an all-in-one app, please leave and go spend your money on some electron app that runs slowly and charges you 10$ per month for writing words next to a checkbox. This is in line with the Unix philosphy: Apps should do one thing, and do it well.

### Customizable
However, lightweight doesn't have to mean no features. The app will have plugins and themes, two standards for app expansion. And because the app is completely open source, anyone can make themes or plugins - so chances are, if there is a feature missing there will be a plugin for it. And if there isn't you can fork the code using Git and make the plugin yourself!

### Intuitive:
The app works how you want. And if it doesn't, you can spend a few minutes in the settings menu, where almost everything can be changed. And this, paired with plugins, means you can make the app work exactly ho you want it to.

### Reminders:
The app features simple notification reminders for when your task is due. 

#### tbc:
There are some features which would be nice to add but would be hard to implement. These include:

*Sync:* An account system so you can access your notes from any device.
<br>
*Other Platforms:* A destop app, or maybe even a web app, to help you be organised whatever you are doing.
